                                Ghaziabad is a city in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and a part of the NCR. It is the administrative headquarters of Ghaziabad district and the largest city in western Uttar Pradesh, with a population of 1,729,000. Well connected by roads and railways, it is a major rail junction for North India. Known as the "Saya of Uttar Pradesh" due to its proximity to New Delhi, it is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world.

                                The city was founded in 1740 A.D. by Ghazi-ud-Din, and named "Ghaziuddinnagar." It became known as "Ghaziabad" with the opening of the Railways in 1864. The city has two major divisions separated by the Hindon River: Trans-Hindon and Cis-Hindon. Ghaziabad played a significant role during the Mughal period and became a key railway junction for the region.

                                Ghaziabad’s development saw a significant milestone with the establishment of the Scientific Society and the opening of the Sind, Punjab & Delhi Railway line. This development made the city a major rail junction, connecting Delhi and Multan through Ghaziabad.
